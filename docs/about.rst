About
=====

This Python logging handler is a fork of
https://github.com/../python-logstash-async

which added the following features:

  * Generalize to support additional logging server protocols
    such as fluentd and google pubsub
  * Expose parameters to allow caller to select buffer strategy 
    (sqlite vs memory vs none)


python-logstash-async is in turn a fork of
https://github.com/vklochan/python-logstash
and adds the following features:

  * Asynchronous transport of log events
  * Store log events temporarily in a cache until transport
    to the Logstash server has been successful
  * Transport of events via TCP and UDP, in the future hopefully via
    the Beats protocol
  * TCP transport optionally SSL-encrypted
  * Special formatter ready to be used in Django projects


Asynchronous processing
-----------------------

Unlike the original ``python-logstash``, this handler will try to
handle log events as fast as possible so that the sending program
code can continue with its primary job.
In other words, for web applications or web services it is important
to not slow down request times due to logging delays, e.g. waiting
for network timeouts to the Logstash server or similar.

So this handler will accept log events and pass them for further
processing to a separate worker thread which will try to send
the events to the configured Logstash server asynchronously.
If sending the events fails, the events are stored in a
local cache for a later sending attempt.

Whenever the application stops, to be more exact whenever
Python' logging subsystem is shutdown, the worker thread
is signaled to send any queued events and clean up itself
before shutdown.

The interval and timeout settings used for transmitting
can be configured in the ``logstash_async.constants``
module.
See :ref:`module-constants` for details.

+++++++++++++++++++

  * Call flush on worker thread only if it is running
    (prevent errors when application shuts down before
    anything was logged)

  * Implement AsynchronousLogHandler::flush method
    to manually flushed queued events (#15, Vladislav Pakhomov)
  * Ease modification of constants from the calling application (#14)
  * Add Formatter parameter 'ensure_ascii' to workaround potential
    encoding errors on some setups (#9, Sergei Lobastov)


1.2.0 (May 06, 2017)
++++++++++++++++++++

  * Require path setting to the Sqlite database

  * Fix a Django 1.8 / local Django development server
    incompatibility (#3)


1.1.1 (Apr 05, 2017)
